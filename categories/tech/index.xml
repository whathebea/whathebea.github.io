      <description>It has been a while since my last post but I swear I haven&amp;rsquo;t given up! It&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite, actually.Â I had to do a project for my internship program which was basically creating a Rest API and connecting it to an Android Application. As it turns out, connecting an API to an app is more of a chore than I thought it would be. I hope I can stick with web development.</description>

      <description>I believe that, nowadays, writing a blog is just one way to make myself aware that I am studying a lot. Maybe I will talk a lot about myself, but the I.T field can sometimes be very harsh on you (or me).

I also feel like there are a lot of commas, but to be honest, I never properly learned how to use commas in English and, that being said, Grammarly is correcting it all for me.</description>
