      <description>I know today is Sunday but I really felt like writing something. It seems like I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about coding and trying to perfect everything that I am learning. This may be personal but, does anyone else feel this way? Before my internship although I was very dedicated it seems that now I am much more focused. Also, I lost two Valorant matches in a row so I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit down.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since my last post but I swear I haven&amp;rsquo;t given up! It&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite, actually.Â I had to do a project for my internship program which was basically creating a Rest API and connecting it to an Android Application. As it turns out, connecting an API to an app is more of a chore than I thought it would be. I hope I can stick with web development.</description>

      <description>A new day! Today is Thursday, October 13th. I started the day by studying Angular for a couple hours. So, today I am going to talk a bit about Angular.
Today I learned about: Components Components are apparently a big part of Angular development! You can create them in the cl or create them by hand. Obviously, creating them with the cl command is a lot easier. The command is the following:</description>

      <description>About me My name is Beatriz and I am a 22-year-old developer based in Brazil. I am currently an intern at IBM. During my internship, I participated in training in Design Thinking, Problem Solving, and Agile. I did many courses about Java that totaled more than 200 hours. I also had hands-on experience with Android development using Java and the development of REST APIs using Java and Spring Boot. I am still nowhere near the end of my learning journey, so I decided to create a blog so I could post and maybe explain some of the concepts that I learn each day.</description>

      <title>What I have been studying</title>

      <description>I believe that, nowadays, writing a blog is just one way to make myself aware that I am studying a lot. Maybe I will talk a lot about myself, but the I.T field can sometimes be very harsh on you (or me). I am aware that, being an intern, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same hardships as regular employees, but it can still be hard. I also feel like there are a lot of commas, but to be honest, I never properly learned how to use commas in English and, that being said, Grammarly is correcting it all for me.</description>
