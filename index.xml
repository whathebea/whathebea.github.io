      <description>About me My name is Beatriz and I am a 22-year-old developer based in Brazil. I am currently an intern at IBM. During my internship, I participated in training in Design Thinking, Problem Solving, and Agile. I did many courses about Java that totaled more than 200 hours. I also had hands-on experience with Android development using Java and the development of REST APIs using Java and Spring Boot. I am still nowhere near the end of my learning journey, so I decided to create a blog so I could post and maybe explain some of the concepts that I learn each day.</description>

      <description>I believe that, nowadays, writing a blog is just one way to make myself aware that I am studying a lot. Maybe I will talk a lot about myself, but the I.T field can sometimes be very harsh on you (or me). I am aware that, being an intern, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same hardships as regular employees, but it can still be hard. I also feel like there are a lot of commas, but to be honest, I never properly learned how to use commas in English and, that being said, Grammarly is correcting it all for me.</description>
