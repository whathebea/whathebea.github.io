      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like making a huge introduction to this post. I will just talk a little bit about what I studied today. If you have already read Jenkins documentation you can probably skip this, I just wanted to explain it to myself.
What is CI/CD? CI CI stands for Continuous Integration and for that you basically merge your code into a main branch as often as possible. This way it&amp;rsquo;s easier to detect bugs and you can fix them before they get to production.</description>
