      <description>I believe that, nowadays, writing a blog is just one way to make myself aware that I am studying a lot. Maybe I will talk a lot about myself, but the I.T field can sometimes be very harsh on you (or me). I am aware that, being an intern, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same hardships as regular employees, but it can still be hard. I also feel like there are a lot of commas, but to be honest, I never properly learned how to use commas in English and, that being said, Grammarly is correcting it all for me.</description>
