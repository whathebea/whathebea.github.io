      <description>Hello everyone! Today I spent most of my day studying for AZ-900, I am following a learning path my company offers so that when the time comes I can take the exam and get certified. I am also thinking of creating a project using all the technologies I am currently studying: Angular, Spring, MySQL. I am mostly still planning it, I think building an e-commerce application will be very useful to showcase my skills.</description>

      <description>I believe that, nowadays, writing a blog is just one way to make myself aware that I am studying a lot. Maybe I will talk a lot about myself, but the I.T field can sometimes be very harsh on you (or me).
